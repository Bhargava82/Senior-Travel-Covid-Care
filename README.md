Welcome to Senior Travel Covid Care Application!
The state of today's public health environment was the inspiration for our application of Senior Travel Covid Care. Our application's target demographic is senior citizens who are traveling (e.g. snowbirds, visiting children out-of-state) and may have been exposed or developed symptoms of COVID-19 and need to find a physician that accepts medicare. Users are able to search for their city and state, physician type, preferred physician gender, and acceptable Covid-risk level for their state. A goal of this application was to be as user-friendly as possible with our target user in mind.
